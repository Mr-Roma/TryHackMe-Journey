In this part i learn the basics of bash as a scripting language in linux shells, i learn about linus as the history, and also perform some scripting in bash. Not only that i also learning flags and switches in bash, like -l, -a, and so many more. Beside that I also learn Remote Dekstop Protocol, and how to connect via SSH to connect to the remote linux device.
